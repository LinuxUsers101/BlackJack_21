# BlackJack_21
I created this Blackjack (21) game as a passion project to bring the classic card game to life. The goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without busting.


Players start with two cards and can hit (draw more) or stand (keep their hand). Face cards count as 10, and Aces can be 1 or 11. The dealer hits until reaching at least 17.
